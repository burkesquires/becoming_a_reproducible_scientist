    "A minimal standard for data analysis and other scientific computations is\n",
    "that they be _reproducible_: that the code and data are assembled in a\n",
    "way so that another group can re-create all of the results (e.g., the\n",
    "figures in a paper). Adopting a workflow that will make your results\n",
    "reproducible will ultimately make your life easier; if a problem (or\n",
    "question) arises somewhere down the line, it will be much easier to\n",
    "correct (or explain).\n",
    "\n",
    "Organizing analyses so that they are reproducible is not easy. It\n",
    "requires diligence and a considerable investment of time: to learn new\n",
    "computational tools, and to organize and document analyses as you go.\n",
    "\n",
    "But _partially reproducible_ is better than _not at all\n",
    "reproducible_. Just try to make your next paper or project better organized\n",
    "than the last.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many paths toward reproducible research, and you shouldn't\n",
    "try to change all aspects your current practices all at once. Identify\n",
