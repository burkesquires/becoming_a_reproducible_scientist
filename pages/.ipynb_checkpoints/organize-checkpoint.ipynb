    "Perhaps the most important step to take towards ease of reproducibility is to be _organized_. Ideally, the names of files and subdirectories are self-explanatory, so that one can tell at a glance what data files contain, what scripts do, and what came from what.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encapsulate everything within one directory**. Have a single directory for a project, containing all of the data, code, and results for that project. This makes it easier to find things, or to zip it all up and hand it off to someone else.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Separate raw data from derived data** and other data summaries. I prefer to have a subdirectory `RawData/` and then another subdirectory `Data/`, or perhaps two other subdirectories `DerivedData/` (containing reformatted, reorganized, or cleaned data files) and `DataSummaries/` (containing summary information, like lists of subjects or genetic markers, or summary statistics extracted from the primary data in order to make a particular graph). This makes it easier to tell the nature of the data in a file, by its location within the project directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Separate the data from the code**. I prefer to put code and data in separate subdirectories. I'll have an `R/` subdirectory and perhaps also `Python/` and `Ruby/` subdirectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use relative paths** (never absolute paths). If you encapsulate all data and code within a single project directory, then you can refer to data files with relative paths (e.g., `../RawData/some_file.csv`). If you were to use an _absolute_ path (like `~/Projects/SomeProject/RawData/some_file.csv` or `C:\\Users\\SomeOne\\Projects\\SomeProject\\RawData\\some_file.csv`) then anyone who wanted to reproduce your results but had the project placed in some other location would have to go in and edit all of those directory/file names.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Choose file names carefully**. I try not to change the names of raw data files that I get from a collaborator (though I'm often tempted to replace spaces with underscores). But scripts need names, and files with derived or cleaned data need names. Be as clear and explicit as possible. The same holds for the variables and functions within your scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Avoid using &ldquo;final&rdquo; in a file name**. Nothing is ever final, and if you call something &ldquo;final&rdquo; you'll end up with things like `cleandata_final_rev3.csv`. If you want to keep multiple versions of a file, just append a number, like `cleandata_v8.csv`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Write ReadMe files**. Even if you've organized and named things perfectly, you'll still want to include some documentation that explains what's what. A `ReadMe.txt` file (or `ReadMe.md`, for [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)) in the main directory and perhaps also in each subdirectory may be sufficient. Describe the files and the process. And keep the ReadMe files up to date as things are added or changed.\n",
