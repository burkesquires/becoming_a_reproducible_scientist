    "\n",
    "You have the full process encoded in scripts, and the data and code are nicely documented and organized. But there'll be a lot of scripts. Your ReadMe file may explain how to run them, and in what order, but it'll be a pain to do all of that. (And your ReadMe file might be a tad out of date!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, the reproduction of your results is a one-button operation. And this is valuable not just for others, but also for yourself (or your future self). For example, if the primary data should change (and it often does), wouldn't it be nice to have one command that re-runs everything?\n",
    "\n",
    "You could do this with a single all-encompassing script. Even better, though, is to use [GNU Make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make). I would argue that Make is the single most important tool for reproducible research.\n",
    "\n",
    "[GNU Make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make) was written for compiling programs from their source code, but it can be used to coordinate any command-line driven process, such as the various scripts that underlie a data analysis project, or the construction of the figures and tables for a paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of Make is that it both automates a process and documents the dependencies in the project: this file is turned into that file with this line of code, and this graph is produced from those files with that script.\n",
    "\n",
    "You create a file, called `Makefile`, and then on the command line type `make`. Here's part of [an example](https://github.com/kbroman/Paper_Rqtl_Experiences/blob/master/Makefile) (for [this paper](http://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/article/view/jors.at/43)):"
