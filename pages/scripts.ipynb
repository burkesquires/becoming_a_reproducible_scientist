    "The most basic aspect of reproducible research is that everything\n",
    "you do (convert data files, clean data, analyze data) should be\n",
    "accomplished via _code_. Pointing and clicking, and copy-paste, are\n",
    "not reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ideally, **get the data in the most-raw form** possible. And get any/all\n",
    "  data and meta data possible. And keep track of the _provenance_ of\n",
    "  all data files. (You don't want to be asking, &ldquo;Where did these\n",
    "  microarray annotations come from?&rdquo;)\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you need to **download external data**, such as from the web, it's\n",
    "  best to do so via a script, for example with\n",
    "  [wget](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/). If that's not feasible,\n",
    "  at least document the source of the data (and perhaps the date/time\n",
    "  it was acquired).\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you need to **convert a data file** from one form to another, use a\n",
    "  script. For example, to convert an Excel file to a CSV file, I use\n",
    "  [xls2csv.py](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xls2csv) or\n",
    "  [xlsx2csv.py](https://github.com/dilshod/xlsx2csv). Rather than\n",
    "  opening the file in excel and saving each sheet by hand, do this\n",
    "  with code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Don't hand-edit data files**. If you need to delete some initial rows,\n",
    "  or if you want to change some column names, don't open up the file\n",
    "  and edit it by hand. Write a script that does so. I like to write\n",
    "  [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) scripts for this sort of thing;\n",
    "  you might use [python](http://www.python.org) or\n",
    "  [perl](https://www.perl.org), or even\n",
    "  [R](http://www.r-project.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "- All aspects of **data cleaning should be in scripts**. If you decide\n",
    "  that you need to omit a couple of subjects, don't go into the data\n",
    "  file and delete those rows, but rather write a script that will\n",
    "  delete those subjects and create a separate, revised data file. If\n",
    "  you find some errors in the data, don't go into the file and change\n",
    "  it by hand, but rather make those changes via a script (or have the\n",
    "  changes made to the primary database, in a documented and versioned\n",
    "  way).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each aspect of the **analysis should be in scripts**. Make these\n",
    "  straight-forward to run. It shouldn't be &ldquo;run this set of lines\n",
    "  to do this and those lines to do that,&rdquo; or even worse,\n",
    "  &ldquo;change this variable and then re-run it to do that.&rdquo;\n",
    "  (I've written _lots_ of scripts like that in the past; they're\n",
    "  neither pretty nor reproducible.) Ideally, break things up into\n",
    "  functions, to make the code easier to follow and to avoid repeated\n",
    "  code. [More on this later](functions.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, it may seem like a hassle to do many of these things via\n",
    "code rather than by hand. But if the primary data should change (and\n",
    "it often does), repeating all of that by-hand extraction and editing\n",
    "is a huge hassle, while re-running the scripts should be super easy\n",
